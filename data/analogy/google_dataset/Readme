The GOOGLE dataset (Mikolov et al., 2013a) contains 19544 questions.  It
covers 14 relation types, 7 of which are semantic in nature and 7 are
morpho-syntactic (enumerated in Section 8). The dataset was created by
manually constructing example word-pairs of each relation, and providing all
the pairs of word-pairs (within each relation type) as analogy questions.
